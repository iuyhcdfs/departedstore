Slice up some mannequins in a shopping mall.

connect a joycon(r) via bluetooth, hold upsidedown with the buttons/stick facing your palm.

pretend to sheath your sword (point it behind you) with your knuckles pointing upwards and press the RZ trigger to reallign your sword

Super thanks to https://github.com/Looking-Glass/JoyconLib which properly translate bluetooth joycons into unity inputs
